# Network-Project

This is my attempt at working with code using a database, user input, and having it affect the website. This website allows you to look at different legends within a video game I am fond of and add more as they are released. Functionality was prioritized over aesthetics in this project, but I believe I successfully completed it and understood the concepts used within.

Concepts used: 
  Javascript
  Express
  MongoDB
  EJS files
  HTML
  CSS

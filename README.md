# Network-Project

This is my attempt at working with code using a database, user input, and having it affect the website. This website allows you to look at different legends within a video game I am fond of and add more as they are released. Functionality was prioritized over aesthetics in this project, but I believe I successfully completed it and understood the concepts used within.
